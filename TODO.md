# Version 0.2

Since instagram streaming is only available on the phone, there is a way to use a virtual camera
in a virtual android phone that takes a virtual obs camera back.

On the obs side its better to use webgpu enabled browser source that runs react xr behind.

The AI calles SoundCloud MCP server to fetch a new song and announce the song too.

## It works

- [X] MCP Server
- [X] AI Call
- [X] Sound

## Ideas

- Establish a front end layer in PReact can be served as an early prototype before XR
- Frontend on [XR](https://github.com/pmndrs/xr)
- Liquid glass design
